# Features

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the features of TESSA (The Extremely Simple System Assistant), your intelligent assistant for managing Proxmox environments. TESSA is designed to make complex virtualization tasks accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.

## Core Features

### Natural Language Interface

TESSA allows you to interact with your Proxmox environment using natural language commands instead of complex command-line syntax.

    F --> G[User Response]
```

- **Command Flexibility**: Issue commands in various ways - "start VM 100", "power on virtual machine 100", or "boot up the VM with ID 100" all work
- **Context Awareness**: TESSA remembers context from previous commands, so you can say "Start VM 100" followed by "Stop it" without repeating the VM ID
- **Conversational Interface**: Ask questions, get recommendations, and receive detailed explanations in plain language
- **Multi-platform Support**: Interact via web interface, CLI, or voice (where available)
