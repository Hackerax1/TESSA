  LANCache has been successfully deployed!
  
  DNS Server IP: <VM_IP>
  
  Client Configuration:
  1. Set your DNS server to <VM_IP> on all devices that should use the cache
  2. Alternatively, configure your router's DHCP to use <VM_IP> as the primary DNS
  
  No further configuration is needed on the server side - the cache will start working automatically.
  
notes: |
  LANCache proxies and caches downloads from:
  - Steam
  - Epic Games
  - Blizzard Battle.net
  - Origin
  - Riot
  - Uplay
  - Windows Updates
  - PlayStation Network
  - Xbox Live
  - Nintendo
  - And more
  
  Benefits:
  - Drastically reduces internet bandwidth usage for multiple downloads
  - Improves download speeds for clients on the local network
  - Especially useful for households with multiple gamers or LAN parties
  - Can cache Windows updates as well as game content
  
  Performance Tips:
  - Allocate as much disk space as possible for better caching
  - Use SSD storage for better performance (but HDD is fine for larger cache sizes)
  - For best results, ensure all clients use the LANCache DNS server
  - Monitor cache hit rates through the included logs
  
  Network Considerations:
  - Ensure your router allows the VM to act as a DNS server
  - For proper operation, make sure the VM has a static IP address
  - If using in a larger network, consider configuring DNS forwarding in your router

requirements:
  network:
    - "Static IP address for the LANCache VM"
    - "Router must allow the VM to act as a DNS server"
    - "Opening ports 53 (UDP), 80 and 443 on the VM's firewall"
