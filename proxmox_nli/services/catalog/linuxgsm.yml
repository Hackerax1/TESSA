  LinuxGSM has been successfully deployed!
  
  To manage your game servers:
  1. SSH into your server as the gameserver user:
     ssh gameserver@<VM_IP>
  
  2. Install a specific game server (example for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive):
     ./linuxgsm.sh csgoserver
     ./csgoserver install
  
  3. Common server commands:
     ./[gameserver] start     - Start the server
     ./[gameserver] stop      - Stop the server
     ./[gameserver] restart   - Restart the server
     ./[gameserver] monitor   - Monitor the server
     ./[gameserver] update    - Update the server
     ./[gameserver] backup    - Backup the server
     ./[gameserver] console   - Access the server console
