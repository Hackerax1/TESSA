  Cloudflare Tunnel Setup Instructions:
  
  1. Install cloudflared CLI:
     - Windows: scoop install cloudflared
     - Linux: curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
     - Mac: brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
  
  2. Authenticate with Cloudflare:
     $ cloudflared tunnel login
  
  3. Create your tunnel:
     $ cloudflared tunnel create homelab
  
  4. Configure your tunnel:
     Create ~/.cloudflared/config.yml with your tunnel settings
  
  5. Start the tunnel:
     $ cloudflared tunnel run
  
  6. Route traffic to your tunnel:
     $ cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel-id> your.domain.com

  For detailed DNS setup:
  1. Log into Cloudflare dashboard (https://dash.cloudflare.com)
  2. Add your domain if not already added
  3. Update nameservers at your registrar to Cloudflare's nameservers
  4. Configure DNS records (automatically done by cloudflared)
  5. Enable SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Full" or "Full (strict)"
  6. Optional: Enable additional security features like WAF and Access

notes: |
  Security Recommendations:
  - Always use Cloudflare Access or IP restrictions to protect sensitive services
  - Enable Cloudflare Zero Trust features for additional security
  - Regularly update cloudflared to get the latest security patches
  - Use separate tunnels for different security contexts
  
  Benefits:
  - No open ports required
  - End-to-end encryption
  - DDoS protection
  - Easy SSL certificate management
  - Zero Trust security features
  
  Common Issues:
  - If tunnel fails to start, check credentials file permissions
  - If DNS not resolving, verify Cloudflare nameservers are configured
  - If SSL errors, check Cloudflare SSL/TLS encryption mode
