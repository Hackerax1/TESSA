  Jellyfin Media Server has been successfully deployed with ZFS storage!
  
  Web interface: http://<VM_IP>:8096
  
  Storage Configuration:
  ZFS datasets have been created at:
  - tank/media/movies: for your movie collection
  - tank/media/tv: for TV shows
  - tank/media/music: for music files
  
  ZFS has been optimized with:
  - LZ4 compression for better storage efficiency
  - 1M recordsize for optimal media streaming
  - Disabled atime to improve performance
  
  To complete setup:
  1. Visit the web interface and complete the initial setup wizard
  2. Add media libraries pointing to:
     - Movies: /movies
     - TV Shows: /tv
     - Music: /music
  3. Create user accounts for family members
  4. Install Jellyfin clients on your devices
  5. Consider enabling hardware transcoding
  6. Set up regular ZFS snapshots for backup:
     zfs snapshot -r tank/media@weekly
