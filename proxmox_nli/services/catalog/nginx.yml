access_info: |
  NGINX Reverse Proxy has been successfully deployed!
  
  To add a service behind the proxy:
  1. Make sure the service is on the same Docker network
  2. Set these environment variables on your services:
     - VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com
     - VIRTUAL_PORT=container_port
     - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com (if using SSL)
  
  The proxy will automatically detect and route traffic to containers with these variables.
notes: |
  This NGINX setup uses the nginx-proxy image which automatically discovers and configures
  proxied containers. It integrates well with Let's Encrypt for automatic SSL certificates.
  
  For optimal security:
  - Create a dedicated Docker network for proxied services
  - Configure proper SSL certificates
  - Set up firewall rules to only allow 80/443 from trusted sources
