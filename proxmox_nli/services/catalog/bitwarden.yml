notes: |
  Vaultwarden is a lightweight, community-driven implementation of the Bitwarden server API:
  - Compatible with official Bitwarden clients
  - More efficient resource usage than the official server
  - Supports all essential Bitwarden features
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)
  
  Security Recommendations:
  - Always use HTTPS (integrate with Cloudflare or Let's Encrypt)
  - Disable public signups after creating necessary accounts
  - Encrypt backups of the vault data
  - Restrict network access to trusted devices/networks
  - Consider using fail2ban to prevent brute force attempts
